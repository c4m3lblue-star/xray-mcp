## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow the existing code structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high test coverage
- Mock external API calls in unit tests

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `Add:` for new features
- `Fix:` for bug fixes
- `Update:` for improvements to existing features
- `Remove:` for removing code or features
- `Docs:` for documentation changes

Example:
```
Add: support for Test Plans management
Fix: authentication token expiry calculation
Update: improve error handling in GraphQL requests
```

### Security

- **NEVER** commit credentials or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Review `.gitignore` before committing
- Check for exposed secrets before pushing
